Siebel-Integration-Com

Version 0.02

The Siebel::Integration::Com modules are designed to remove the different method calls and eror checking between the COM Data Control and COM Data Server interfaces. 
Changing between the two interfaces only requires a change in the parameters to Siebel::Integration::Com->new() rather than a rewrite of all calls.
Beyond just replicating the base functions of the interfaces it is hoped that additional methods will be added to these modules to extend the functionality provided by the Siebel COM framework.

All methods that have been exposed keep the same names so there is no additional learning curve, you can program in Perl using the same method names as eScript
